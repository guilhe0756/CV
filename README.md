#### Who I am

I'm what you get when you cross a hippie education with a geeky mentality; someone curious about people and their relationship with technology. I have lived with Amazonian shamans and tried to grasp their use of flash drives ([I'm serious!] (hhttps://www.academia.edu/38627418/The_Shaman_and_the_Flash_Drive), and now I wish to code my way into the relationship between humans and machines. Ideally, I'd be working to finish this joke: "Two algorithms walk into the deep web..."

## Skills

#### Research

I have more than 12 years of experience in planning and executing qualitative research. I have mostly done this while doing my MA and Phd in Social Anthropology, but I have also worked in NGOs and as a consultant. 

A big part of university research is about getting it funded in the first place. Both my Masters and PhD were fully funded and afterwards I managed to secure the prestigious [British Academy Newton International Fellowship] (https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/newton-international-fellowships-2016-awards-list). 

#### Communication

I firmly believe that communicating your ideas with clarity is paramount to anything in life. 

I have practiced communication skills while doing research – what anthropologists called fieldwork – and while working at universities. 

- As a researcher, I have presented my work in several universities (including Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, and St. Andrews), sometimes talking for a couple of hours. It is challenging to maintain clarity while speaking for so long. 
- As a lecturer, I have also led tutorials and seminars where I had to encourage a group of students to talk. Engaging people on a subject can be tough, but I thoroughly enjoyed this side of teaching (much more than giving lecture, to be honest). 
– I once gave a 15 minute talk at the Brazilian National Prosecutor's Office about the situation of indigenous Amazonian groups in the face of environmental destruction and deforestation. People were really moved, some cried – which served me as a costant reminder of the power of words.  


## Education

#### Makers Academy (March '19 to June '19)

[TBA]

#### University College London (Nov '16 to Feb '19)

- Postdoctoral research on linguistic and social anthropology
- Basically, I tried to come up with an alternative (non-western) way of thinking about language based on my experience with linguistic aspects of Amerindian songs. 
    - Not sure if I was successful yet, but [this publication] (https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/language-and-communication/vol/63/suppl/C) seems to be getting a lot of attention. 

#### Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro - Brazil (Mar '09 to Dec '15)

- I did both my MA and my PhD here, where I studied social anthropology and focused on:
      - Amazonia, ritual singing, linguistic anthropology, kinship, drunkeness, and social uses of technology. 

- If you read portuguese and want to read something about the people I worked with – the Araweté – you might want to check [this] (https://www.sescsp.org.br/online/edicoes-sesc/512_ARAWETE+UM+POVO+TUPI+DA+AMAZONIA#/tagcloud=lista) and [this] (https://revistacult.uol.com.br/home/palavras-quebradas-na-poetica-arawete/) out.
