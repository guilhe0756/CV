I'm what you get when you cross a hippie education with a geeky mentality; someone curious about people and their relationship with technology. I have lived with Amazonian shamans and tried to grasp their use of flash drives ([I'm serious!](https://www.academia.edu/38627418/The_Shaman_and_the_Flash_Drive)), and now I wish to code my way into the relationship between humans and machines. I am passionate about coding, for it blends my lifelong interest in the multiple shapes of human languages – their syntax, sense, and sound – to a digital environment in which I have felt confortable for a while.

## <a name="background">Background</a>

After graduating in 2008, I pursued an academic career for ten years, in which I focused on the social relations of South American Indigenous societies. I lived with the Araweté – a small Amazonian people – for 16 months in the Brazilian Amazon, an experience that allowed me to write a PhD on the Araweté's conceptualisations of the relationship between humans and non-human entities (gods, spirits, and animals). I moved to London in 2016 to do research, but grew increasingly uninterested in an academic career, which lead me to pursue a long-time interest in coding through a bootcamp at Makers Academy.

|[Guac-a-mole](https://github.com/guilhe0756/guac-a-mole)| As our final project at Makers, my group and I chose to build a game. We built a 2d Whack-a-mole game from scratch while learning completely new technologies such as Unity and C#. Given that we only had 6 days to code this, we were very proud with what we [ended up with.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GuacaMole.WhackaMole)| 2 weeks | C#, Unity 3D | Unity Cloud Build/Unity Test Runner(NUnit)|
|[Your Random Chomsky](https://github.com/guilhe0756/your-random-chomsky-js)|Have you ever woken up to the feeling 'I need to read a meaningless random sentence inspired by Noam Chomsky's book Syntactic Structures RIGHT NOW!' Well, of course not. BUT NOW YOU CAN! An alternative version of this project, in Ruby, is [here](https://github.com/guilhe0756/random-chomsky-generator).| Ongoing (estimate: 3 weeks) | Javascript, Express | Circle CI, Jasmine, nyc, Nightwatch|
|[Acebook](https://github.com/stuartpet/acebook-steam)| Ruby on Rails version of the Acebook challenge, during which we built a social media platform. | 2 weeks | Ruby on Rails, SQL (Active Record) | Travis, Heroku, RSpec, Simplecov, Rubocop, Codacy |
|[Command line bowling](https://github.com/guilhe0756/bowling-challenge)| On my take on this classic challenge, I choose to write a node.js command line version of the bowling challenge.| 24 hours | Javascript | Jasmine, Istanbul|

### Test Driven Development

While at bootcamp, I have enbodied the idea of TDD as a central tool in my coding skills. To me, TDD is interesting not only because if provides a sense of security and cohesiveness while building software, but also because it is [counter-intuitive.](https://medium.com/@guilhermexunu/the-house-of-tdd-62df5069968)

### Modelling

Diagrams and models provide us with a clear snapshot of the flow of a specific action and the overall logic of a system. In programming, writing and designing models through diagrams has helped me imagine what I'm building [will look like](https://github.com/guilhe0756/your-random-chomsky-js/blob/master/public/images/diagram.png) and be aware of [how different technologies overlap.](https://github.com/stuartpet/acebook-steam/blob/master/app/assets/config/images/diagram.png) 

### Research

I have more than 12 years of experience in planning and executing qualitative research, mostly in an academic environment, but also as a consultant for NGOs and in advocacy. 

Both my Masters and PhD were fully funded by scholarships and afterwards I managed to secure the prestigious [British Academy Newton International Fellowship](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/newton-international-fellowships-2016-awards-list). 

### Communication

I firmly believe that communicating your ideas with clarity is paramount to anything in life. 

I have practiced communication skills while doing research – what anthropologists called fieldwork – and while working at universities and as a consultant. 

- As a researcher, I gave several hour-long talks about my research in different universities – [Oxford](https://www.anthro.ox.ac.uk/event/two-songs-for-a-red-girl-music-and-language-in-eastern-amazonia), [UCL](https://therai.org.uk/committees/events-in-anthropology-language), and [St. Andrews](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/anthropology/event/singing-as-the-unmaking-of-relations-amongst-the-arawete-amazonia-brasil/)). 
- As a lecturer, I have led tutorials and seminars with undergraduate and postgraduate students.
- As a consultant, I have conducted interviews with scientists and the public about climate change, which gave me the experience on how to make [sicentific discourse acessible to a broader audience.](https://www.frameworksinstitute.org/assets/files/brazil/brazil_climate_change_mtg_report_2015.pdf)

### Languages

Thinking and practicing language is one of my favourite things. I have a good knowledge of languages spoken by vast amounts of people (Portugues, English, Spanish, and German) as well as of a language spoken by only 500 people in the world (Araweté). 

I can break down a sentence into its internal components, a skill that I use now to break down and comprehend the [components of programming languages.](https://medium.com/@guilhermexunu/a-random-sentence-generator-97c27bbb3fe6)  

## <a name="experience">Experience</a>

**University College London** (Nov '16 to Feb '19)

- Postdoctoral research on linguistic and social anthropology
- I tried to come up with an alternative (non-western) way of thinking about language based on my experience with linguistic aspects of Amerindian songs. 
    - Not sure if I was successful yet, but [this publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/language-and-communication/vol/63/suppl/C) seems to be getting a lot of attention.

**Frameworks** (Mar '15 to Sep '15)

- I worked as a researcher on a project about Climate Change in Brazil. 
- I conducted interviews with scientific experts and with the general public. 

## <a name="education">Education</a>

#### Makers Academy (March '19 to June '19)

- At Makers, I learned to code and to be confident that I can build anything. Give me a task (and some time), and I will find the appropriate programming language and framework to implement it. 

- Technologies that I have used so far:
*Testing Frameworks*: RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Nightwatch, NUnit, unittest;
*Languages*: Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Python, Lua;
*Web Frameworks*: Sinatra, Express, Ruby on Rails;
*Databases*: PostgreSQL (including Active Record);
*CI/CD*: Travis CI, Unity Cloud Build, Heroku, Circle CI;
*Code Quality, Coverage*: Rubocop, Istanbul, Eslint, Codacy;
*Game engines*: Unity 3D

#### Museu Nacional, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil (Mar '09 to Dec '15)

- I did both my MA and my PhD here, where I studied social anthropology and focused on:
      - Amazonia, ritual singing, linguistic anthropology, kinship, and social uses of technology. 

- If you read portuguese and want to read something about the people I worked with – the Araweté – you might want to check [this](https://www.sescsp.org.br/online/edicoes-sesc/512_ARAWETE+UM+POVO+TUPI+DA+AMAZONIA#/tagcloud=lista) and [this](https://revistacult.uol.com.br/home/palavras-quebradas-na-poetica-arawete/) out.
