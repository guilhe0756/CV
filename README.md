I'm what you get when you cross a hippie education with a geeky mentality; someone curious about people and their relationship with technology. I have lived with Amazonian shamans and tried to grasp their use of flash drives ([I'm serious!](https://www.academia.edu/38627418/The_Shaman_and_the_Flash_Drive), and now I wish to code my way into the relationship between humans and machines.

|[Guac-a-mole](https://github.com/guilhe0756/guac-a-mole)| As our final project at Makers, my group and I chose to build a game. We built a 2d Whack-a-mole game from scratch while learning completely new technologies such as Unity and C#. Given that we only had 6 days to code this, we were very proud with what we [ended up with.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.GuacaMole.WhackaMole)| 2 weeks | C#, Unity 3D | Unity Cloud Build/Unity Test Runner(NUnit)|

### Research

I have more than 12 years of experience in planning and executing qualitative research. I have mostly done this while doing my MA and Phd in Social Anthropology, but I have also worked in NGOs and as a consultant. 

A big part of university research is about getting it funded in the first place. Both my Masters and PhD were fully funded and afterwards I managed to secure the prestigious [British Academy Newton International Fellowship](https://www.thebritishacademy.ac.uk/newton-international-fellowships-2016-awards-list). 

### Communication

I firmly believe that communicating your ideas with clarity is paramount to anything in life. 

I have practiced communication skills while doing research – what anthropologists called fieldwork – and while working at universities. 

- As a researcher, I have presented my work in several universities (including Oxford, Cambridge, UCL, and St. Andrews), sometimes talking for a couple of hours. It is challenging to maintain clarity while speaking for so long. 
- As a lecturer, I have also led tutorials and seminars where I had to encourage a group of students to talk. Engaging people on a subject can be tough, but I thoroughly enjoyed this side of teaching (more than giving lectures, to be honest).

- I once gave a 15 minute talk at the Brazilian National Prosecutor's Office about the situation of indigenous Amazonian groups in the face of environmental destruction and deforestation. People were really moved, some cried – which served me as a costant reminder of the power of words.

- As a consultant, I have conducted interviews with scientists and the public about climate change as part of a researcher for the Frameworks Institute. Our task was to map the possible bridges and the common shortfalls in the communication of scientific work on climate change to a larger audience. This gave me the opportunity to see that making science public is almost as important doing it. 

### Language

Thinking and practicing language is one of my favourite things. I have a good knowledge of languages spoken by vast amounts of people (Portugues, English, Spanish, and German) as well as of a language spoken by only 500 people in the world (Araweté). 

At the moment, I'm starting to look at how programming languages are "spoken", and I wonder why so many are written in English. 

## <a name="experience">Experience</a>

**University College London** (Nov '16 to Feb '19)

- Postdoctoral research on linguistic and social anthropology
- Basically, I tried to come up with an alternative (non-western) way of thinking about language based on my experience with linguistic aspects of Amerindian songs. 
    - Not sure if I was successful yet, but [this publication](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/language-and-communication/vol/63/suppl/C) seems to be getting a lot of attention.

**Frameworks** (Mar '15 to Sep '15)

- I worked as a researcher on a project about Climate Change in Brazil. 
- I conducted interviews with scientific experts and with the general public. 

## <a name="education">Education</a>

#### Makers Academy (March '19 to June '19)

- At Makers, I learned to code and to be confident that I can build anything. Give me a task (and some time), and I will find the appropriate programming language and framework to implement it. 

- Technologies that I have used so far:
*Testing Frameworks*: RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Nightwatch, NUnit, unittest;
*Languages*: Ruby, JavaScript, C#, Python, Lua;
*Web Frameworks*: Sinatra, Express, Ruby on Rails;
*Databases*: PostgreSQL (including Active Record);
*CI/CD*: Travis CI, Unity Cloud Build, Heroku;
*Code Quality, Coverage*: Rubocop, Istanbul, Eslint, Codacy;
*Game engines*: Unity 3D

#### Museu Nacional, Rio de Janeiro - Brazil (Mar '09 to Dec '15)

- I did both my MA and my PhD here, where I studied social anthropology and focused on:
      - Amazonia, ritual singing, linguistic anthropology, kinship, and social uses of technology.
